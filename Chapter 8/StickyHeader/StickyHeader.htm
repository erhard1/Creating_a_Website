<h1>Remains to Be Seen</h1>
<p>Tell him time is of the essence. You look&hellip;perfect. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm really more an apartment person. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</p>
<h2>Left Turn Ahead</h2>
<p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I am not a killer. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
<li>I have a dark side, too.</li>
<li>You're a killer. I catch killers.</li>
<li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</li>

<p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I have a dark side, too. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</p>
<h4>Practically Perfect</h4>
<p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Like a sloth. I can do that. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I am not a killer.</p>

<h5>Left Turn Ahead</h5>
<p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.</p>
