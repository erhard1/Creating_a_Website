<h1>A Trip to Remember</h1>
<p><img src="me.jpg" class="float" alt="Me" />After returning from my three-month travel adventure, I found myself bitter 
and depressed. Fortunately, all it took was a little HTML wizardry to build this 
website commemorating my journey!</p>
<p>Now, anytime I miss my life-altering odyssey, all I need to do is bask in the 
blinking artificial light of my 14&quot; computer monitor and, in the few spare 
moments of free time I have between soul-crushing data entry work at the 
chronically understaffed dot-com where I work, enjoy my carefully positioned and 
distinctly un-pixelated images.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these pictures as much as I do.</p>
