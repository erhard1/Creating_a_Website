<p>HTML is a more freewheeling standard. When you create an HTML document, you 
don’t know who’s going to look at it, or what their computers will support. The 
way your document is displayed could change dramatically depending on whether 
the person viewing your document turns on large text, shrinks the browser window 
to microscopic proportions, or switches off pictures. And if people surf to your 
page using a trendy pocket PC, they’ll get a completely different perspective 
than what you’ll see with the latest widescreen computer monitor.</p>

<p>HTML was designed to head off these problems by giving you less control. 
Instead of allowing you to place everything exactly, HTML forces you to use tags 
to shape the basic structure of your work (for example, to indicate paragraphs, 
headings, and lists). However, it’s up to the browser to decide how to display 
these details on a given computer. In other words, HTML was designed as a 
compromise that sacrifices control for simplicity, flexibility, and 
compatibility.</p>
